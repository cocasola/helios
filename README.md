# Helios
Helios is a general purpose development platform written in C with a fundamental focus on modularity, power, and control. Helios aims to aid development rather than strictly guide it by putting the user in the driver's seat.


### 2024/10/31 Note

This project is not in a usable or polished state, with a lot of functionality elsewhere in C++ unimplemented. But, this is probably the most coherent monolithic collection of engine source code I have written. When I have the time I plan on rewriting/collecting everything with Zig.
